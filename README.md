I'll be using this project to teach myself Symfony2, using version 2.3.

I'll be following along with the tutorial from http://www.ens.ro/2012/03/21/jobeet-tutorial-with-symfony2/
and attempting to update it to the current version of Symfony as needed.

As an added degree of difficulty, I'm also forcing myself to learn git.

So this should be fun and exciting.
